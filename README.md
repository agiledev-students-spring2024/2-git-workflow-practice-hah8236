# The Role of a Music Software Engineer: Advancements and Skills

[This article from Yellowbrick](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/music/the-role-of-a-music-software-engineer-advancements-and-skills) shares some basic information about the role of a music software engineer. I personally enjoy reading about how software engineering is used in industries that are not typically though of as being related to tech. Like many others, I have spent a lot of my life being intriqued by the idea of working somewhere within the entertainment industry, so this sort of career path would definitely be on I'd like to look into more in the future.

One thing I will add, is that the article itself feels a bit like a promotion for the NYU Tisch and Billboard course about the music industry, which upon further research, makes sense since Yellowbrick is the host of this online course.
